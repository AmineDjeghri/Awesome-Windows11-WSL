# TV Setup
One of the best TV OS is Google TV. Here are some reasons why you should consider using Google TV:
- Sideloading apps is straightforward on Google TV. You can install apps like Stremio, SmartTube, and others.
- It's not as responsive as Apple TV, but you can tweak it to make it faster.
- A new version of Chromecast with Google TV is coming soon. It will have a better performance.

## All TV types:
- My first advice is to never use the standard mode on your TV. Always use the cinema/ filmaker or movie mode. The
  standard mode is too bright and the colors are not accurate. Use the cinema or movie mode when watching movies or
  series.
- Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3M_h30HYc) explaining TV modes.
  And [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTO2Wmw1NKA) for changing the settings of your TV taking into
  account different modes (SDR, HDR, Dolby). (You can refer to reddit guides or YouTube videos
  or [rtings.com](rtings.com) to find the best settings).
- If your TV supports multiple content types (SDR, HDR, DOLBY), the mode needs to be activated on each content type.
- On some TVs like the Hisense U7k, you need to enable enhanced HDMI mode to access dolby vision & 60HZ on your
  chromecast and other HDMI inputs.
- If you play video games, use the game mode. It will reduce the input lag and improve the gaming experience.
